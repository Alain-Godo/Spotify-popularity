# Spotify popularity

This is a simple attempt to analyze the popularity reached by global songs (1922-2021) using features obtained from the Spotify API. To predict the popularity is selected the best-performed model from the following techniques: Linear Regression, Tree Decision, and Random Forest. 

Two versions of the Random Forest model are made, taking or not into consideration the artist's name as a feature, showing the influence of marketing and social media on the results.
